# Original IQ Test Solver

While at a restaurant in Pismo Beach, California, my kids found a little peg
board game called "The Original IQ Tester." There is a triangle with 15 holes,
one of which is empty. Each move you can jump one peg over another into an
empty hole, like in checkers. The goal is to end up with one peg left.

It made me curious how many outcomes lead to a single peg remaining, and how
many different games there were, so I wrote some code.

Total games: 1167320

Outcomes:

- 1 left: 17702
- 2 left: 192679
- 3 left: 471383
- 4 left: 384524
- 5 left: 87984
- 6 left: 10956
- 7 left: 1851
- 8 left: 195
- 9 left: 38
- 10 left: 7
- 11 left: 1
- 12 left: 0
- 13 left: 0
- 14 left: 0
